> dflow exports a [fun](https://github.com/fibo/dflow/blob/master/src/engine/fun.js) function â˜º

It has the following signature.

```
/**
 * Create a dflow function.
 *
 * @param {Object} graph to be executed
 * @param {Object} [additionalFunctions] is a collection of functions
 *
 * @returns {Function} dflowFun that executes the given graph
 */
```

`dflow.fun(graph)` returns a *dflowFun* function which has also a *graph* property, to remember that it is a function generated by *dflow*.

Actually *dflow* exposes also the following functions, available only inside a *dflow* graph:

  * [dflow.fun](https://github.com/fibo/dflow/blob/master/src/engine/fun.js)
  * [dflow.isDflowFun](https://github.com/fibo/dflow/blob/master/src/engine/isDflowFun.js)
  * [dflow.validate](https://github.com/fibo/dflow/blob/master/src/engine/validate.js)
