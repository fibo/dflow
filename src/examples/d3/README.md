d3 example
===

From [D3 Custom Bundle](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/bb09af4c39c79cffcde4) example.

Cd into this folder, then run `npm i` and open *index.html*.

Actually, dflow features used are agnostic to d3, for instance they are

1. resolve task (i.e. d3) from global context
2. dot-operator-like tasks, .quz()
