## Stream playground

[Node.js Stream Playground](http://ejohn.org/blog/node-js-stream-playground/) first example is

```js
var fs = require("fs");

// Read File
fs.createReadStream("input/people.json")
    // Write File
    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream("output/people.json"));
```

It is ported to script [stream.js](https://github.com/fibo/dflow/blob/master/src/examples/stream-playground/stream.js) which evaluates [graph stream.json](https://github.com/fibo/dflow/blob/master/src/examples/stream-playground/stream.json) using [few custom functions](https://github.com/fibo/dflow/blob/master/src/examples/stream-playground/funcs.js).

## Packaged graph

The main advantage of *dflow* design is that you do not need to write components or plugins to extend it. You can use one of the most powerful JavaScript features: functions. Write your functions or import them from other packages like *JQuery* or *underscore* and you are able to use them as *tasks* and connect them with *pipes*.

Also every *dflow* graph is a function itself, so why not packaging it and put it on [npm](https://npm.im)!?

It is really easy: create your *dflow* graph and save it to a JSON file, *index.json* for instance; then launch `npm init` as usual and when prompted for the *entry point* write *index.json*.

Simple as that, see [npm-package-minimal](https://github.com/fibo/dflow/tree/master/src/examples/packages/npm-package-minimal) as an example.

For a more complete example, see [npm-package-template](https://github.com/fibo/dflow/tree/master/src/examples/packages/npm-package-template).
