## Hello world

The following simple graph is executed client side by *dflow* engine.

[![Hello World](http://g14n.info/dflow/svg/hello-world.svg)][hello-world]

## Installation

### Client side

If you have some [graphs](#specification) ready to run on client side, you can install dflow engine with [bower](http://bower.io/)

```bash
bower install dflow
```

or use a CDN adding this to your HTML page

```
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/fibo/dflow/master/dist/dflow.min.js"></script>
```

Client distribution contains just the engine and minified version is around **12KB**.

### Server side

If you are new to *dflow*, you probably want to try the [editor][dflow-editor], so you need to install globally to get *dflow* cli in your path.
With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) do

```bash
npm install dflow -g
```

However, if you need to require the *dflow* engine in your package, or you need to browserify it, or even you want to use the *dflow* cli in your npm scripts, or whatever, you can install *dflow* locally with

```bash
npm install dflow
```

If you want start hacking on *dflow* run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fibo/dflow.git
cd dflow
npm install
npm start
```

which will clone repo, install deps, start the *dflow* cli and open your browser.

## Support and License

*dflow* is [MIT](http://g14n.info/mit-license) licensed.

It is developed in my spare time and, as far as I know, by now *I am my only user*.
By the way, I got a stimulating feedback by [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com/)'s founder, who is pretty much interested in using *dflow* maybe in the future. **Grazie** Giuliano, I hope you all the best.

I wrote few times a [Dataflow engine][4], the first one was PNI (Perl Node Interface) and the design evolved until I could say confidently that **dflow is here to stay**.

Use cases I can think about *dflow* right now are many, but, the possibilities are I.M.H.O. outstanding: from client to server, from JavaScript to cross language, from mono-thread to graphs distributed on a network and, above all, from skilled programmer who implement functions â€¦ to artists, genetic engineers, data scientists, etc. that use those functions to create *dflow* graphs and get results nobody could even imagine.

If this is also your vision or you just want to use *dflow*, [contact me](http://g14n.info).

My goal is to say to a *dflow* user:

> Mamma mia! Did you achieve that with dflow?
