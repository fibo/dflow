## Status

*dflow* is **beta** software.
The engine is almost stable.
The [editor][5] is usable but with no css (help me!): I have just started using React to implement the editor view.
Collaborative editing feature is working but buggy (I am proud of my bugs and they will be fixed in version **1.0** :)).

Next steps:

* start using *dflow*,
* improve editor's look&feel,
* add more examples using the editor
* and go for a stable version!

## Installation

### Client side

If you have some [graphs](#specification) ready to run on client side, you can install dflow engine with [bower](http://bower.io/)

```bash
$ bower install dflow
```

### Server side

If you are new to *dflow*, you probably want to try the [editor][5], so you need to install globally to get *dflow* cli in your path.
With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) do

```bash
$ npm install dflow -g
```

However, if you need to require the *dflow* engine in your package, or you need to browserify it, or even you want to use the *dflow* cli in your npm scripts, or whatever, you can install *dflow* locally with

```bash
$ npm install dflow
```

If you want start hacking on *dflow* run

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fibo/dflow.git
$ cd dflow
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

which will clone repo, install deps, and start the *dflow* cli.
Then point your browser to *http://localhost:3000* and edit your graph.
Note that by opening another browser window you can try the **collaborative editing** feature, powered by [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/)!

Note that `npm start` will edit a graph **in memory**, if you want to edit your graph and save it to a file, for instance *graph.json*, launch

```
$ npm start -- graph.json
```

## Support and License

*dflow* is [MIT](http://g14n.info/mit-license) licensed.

It is developed in my spare time and, as far as I know, by now *I am my only user*.
By the way, I got a stimulating feedback by [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com/)'s founder, who is pretty much interested in using *dflow* maybe in the future. **Grazie** Giuliano, I hope you all the best.

I wrote few times a [Dataflow engine][4], the first one was PNI (Perl Node Interface) and the design evolved until I could say confidently that **dflow is here to stay**.

Use cases I can think about *dflow* right now are many, but, the possibilities are I.M.H.O. outstanding: from client to server, from JavaScript to cross language, from mono-thread to graphs distributed on a network and, above all, from skilled programmer who implement functions â€¦ to artists, genetic engineers, data scientists, etc. that use those functions to create *dflow* graphs and get results nobody could even imagine.

If this is also your vision or you just want to use *dflow*, [contact me](http://g14n.info).

My goal is to say to a *dflow* user:

> Mamma mia! Did you achieve that with dflow?
