# dflow examples

First you need to build the project. It requires just two `npm` commands,
see [how to build](../../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#build) for instructions.

Then you can run examples via an npm script:

<!-- This Markdown code syntax makes it easier to copy&paste commands. -->

    npm run example:hello_world
    npm run example:usage
    npm run example:context
    npm run example:async_nodes
