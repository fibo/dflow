# dflow

> is a minimal [Dataflow programming][dataflow-wikipedia] engine

## Support and License

_dflow_ is [MIT](http://g14n.info/mit-license) licensed, yes you can use it to
build a product on top of it!

I wrote few times a [Dataflow engine][dataflow-wikipedia], the first one was PNI
(Perl Node Interface) and the design evolved until I could say confidently that
**dflow is here to stay**.

Use cases I can think about _dflow_ right now are many, but, the possibilities
are I.M.H.O. outstanding: from client to server, from JavaScript to cross
language, from mono-thread to graphs distributed on a network using AWS Lambda
and, above all, from skilled programmer who implement functions â€¦ to artists,
genetic engineers, data scientists, etc. that use those functions to create
_dflow_ graphs and get results nobody could even imagine.

If this is also your vision or you just want to use _dflow_,
[contact me](http://g14n.info).

My goal is to say to a _dflow_ user:

> Mamma mia! Did you achieve that with dflow?
