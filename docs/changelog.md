## TODO

- Add drag node event to flow-view, otherwise no event is fired when moving nodes
- Custom canvas node???
- accessor nodes should complain when information that will lost is provided, for instance {a: Math.cos} will be stringifyied as '{}' by JSON.
- accessor nodes displayed as custom nodes. If you click them, a modal is opened to edit them if they are not connected, they can also show a preview of their values
- find a smart way to show output values, it should be like vvvv debug you can apply it to a single task or the whole subgraph or graph
- can edit subgraphs, canvas should be able to empty and show the subgraphwhile a navbat like   root / subgraph1 / subgraph2 with dropdowns let you navigate throw the tree.
- Implement RUN_ONCE editor action (already there), add Run button and make it work.
- Consider adding cool libraries like threejs and d3 as ready to add nodeswhich add them from CDN.
